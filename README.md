Current project is developed by PhD student in water treatment - Yaroslav Smolin. I study mathematical modeling and optimization of water treatment processes that allow to define the best purification settings and to reduce expenses on plant building. I concentrate on water treatment methods that can efficiently and economically remove toxic synthetic organic substances (biofiltration and
adsorption).
The main idea is to share code with a comunity and store developed projects in a cloud.

#isotermAPI
GUI and model for adsorption isoterm fitting
used: MATLAB + fitting and optimization toolbox

##Support isoterms:
* BET
* Freundlich
* Freundlich-linear
* Langmure
* Freudlich-Langmure
* Langmure-Linear
* Linear
* Polanyi
* Polanyi-linear
* Toth
* Temkin
* Redlich-Peterson

##Description
You can easily add your own isoterms, just modify Model.m file.
Program calculate confidence interval, R square, SSE.
You can set aqua solubility parameter or set autofiting

#Bioadsoption model
Implemented improved bioadsoption model using developments of Institute of Colloid and Water Chemistry.

#Biodegradetion parameters fitting
Implemented ideas from paper "4-nitrophenol biodegradation in a sequencing batch reactor:
kinetic study and effect of filling time" by M. Concetta Tomeia, M. Cristina Annesinib, S. Bussolettib
